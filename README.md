# cis-11-project-andrade-trujillo-lane
LC-3 Assembly program that calculates maximum, minimum, and average test scores from keyboard input and displays them with letter grades. Class project for CIS-11 at Moreno Valley College.

## How to Use (Windows)
This program requires an [LC-3 assembler and simulator](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html) to assemble and run. To assemble the LC-3 program, open the .asm in LC3Edit.exe, and use Translate -> Assemble. This will produce a binary, object file, and symbol table.

To run, open the .obj file in Simulate.exe, then use Execute -> Run or press F5.

The program will then prompt the user in the console to enter a test score (number from 0 to 100) five times. After the scores are entered, the program will calculate maximum, minimum, and average score values, then display them to the console with appropriate letter grades.
